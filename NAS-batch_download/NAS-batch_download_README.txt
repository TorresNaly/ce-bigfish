##### 240129 - OK, overall, this code works great. It connects to the NAS, downloads R3D and R3D_REF files for each image and organizes it in its own subdirectory. Multiple reps can be specified in the "experiment info" box to iterate and download reps of an experiment at once. These folders can then be transferred to alpine for analysis. Still need to clean notebook, but all the funtionality is there. 

##### Note: The analysis pipeline depends on this file hirerarchy for the input.
