# Convert deltavision files to png automatically
Author: Naly Torres

# Description
Repository to automatically download and visualize deltavision files stored in the Network-attached storage (NAS). This repository uses PySMB to access and transfer data between NAS and a local (your computer) or a remote server (Alpine-HPC). Microscope images are then organized in subdirectories ready for creating a report (use deconvolved version) or image analysis (use non-deconvolved version).

    B -->|Input:\n DV files deconvolved or non-deconvolved \n  and reference image | C[Split channels and max project]
    C --> D[save all in a  subdirectory, \n repeat for all images in experiment folder]
