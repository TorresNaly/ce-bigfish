```{r}
# Shapiro-Wilk test for normality
shapiro.test(combined_data$`erm 1 mRNA molecules`)

```
Interpretation
W Statistic:

The W statistic measures how well the data matches a normal distribution. A value closer to 1 indicates that the data is more normally distributed.
In this case, 
�
=
0.53287
W=0.53287, which is quite far from 1, suggesting a significant deviation from normality.
P-value:

The p-value tests the null hypothesis that the data is normally distributed.
Here, the p-value is 
1.529
×
1
0
−
9
1.529×10 
−9
  (which is much smaller than common alpha levels like 0.05 or 0.01).
Conclusion
Since the p-value is extremely low (far below 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis of normality.
This indicates that the erm 1 mRNA molecules data is not normally distributed.



```{r}
# Perform ANOVA
anova_result <- aov(`erm 1 mRNA molecules` ~ subdirectory, data = combined_data)

# Display ANOVA summary
summary(anova_result)

# Perform Tukey's post hoc test
tukey_result <- TukeyHSD(anova_result)

# Display Tukey's post hoc test results
print(tukey_result)

```



#Non-parametric Alternatives -> used when the distribution of the data is not normal
```{r}
# Kruskal-Wallis test
kruskal.test(`erm 1 mRNA molecules` ~ subdirectory, data = combined_data)

```

Interpretation
Kruskal-Wallis Chi-Squared:

The test statistic for the Kruskal-Wallis test is 10.752. This statistic measures the degree of association between the groups and the ranks of the data.
Degrees of Freedom (df):

The degrees of freedom for this test are 2, which corresponds to the number of groups minus one (in this case, there are 3 groups).
P-value:

The p-value is 0.004625, which is the probability of observing the test statistic under the null hypothesis (no differences between groups).
Conclusion
Since the p-value (0.004625) is less than the common significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis.
This means that there are significant differences in the erm 1 mRNA molecules between the different subdirectory groups.




```{r}

# Install and load the 'dunn.test' package if not already installed
# if (!requireNamespace("dunn.test", quietly = TRUE)) {
#     install.packages("dunn.test")
# }
# library(dunn.test)

# Perform Dunn's test with Bonferroni adjustment
dunn_result <- dunn.test(combined_data$`erm 1 mRNA molecules`, combined_data$subdirectory, method = "bonferroni")

# Print Dunn's test results
print(dunn_result)



```
Kruskal-Wallis Test
Chi-squared = 10.752, df = 2, p-value = 0.004625
Interpretation: The p-value is less than 0.05, indicating that there are significant differences in erm 1 mRNA molecules between the different subdirectory groups according to the Kruskal-Wallis test.
Dunn's Test (Post Hoc Test for Kruskal-Wallis)
Pairwise Comparisons:
PP7 vs PP7xSMG-1: p = 1.000 (not significant)
PP7 vs WT: p = 0.0076 (significant)
PP7xSMG-1 vs WT: p = 0.0123 (significant)
Interpretation: Adjusted p-values indicate significant differences between PP7 and WT (p = 0.0076) and between PP7xSMG-1 and WT (p = 0.0123). No significant difference was found between PP7 and PP7xSMG-1 (p = 1.000).
Conclusion
Given the non-normal distribution of the data, the Kruskal-Wallis test is more appropriate than ANOVA. The Kruskal-Wallis test results indicate significant differences between groups, and Dunn's post hoc test specifies that these differences are primarily between:

PP7 and WT
PP7xSMG-1 and WT
No significant difference was found between PP7 and PP7xSMG-1.
